    <h1>How to play</h1>
    <p>Welcome to the game! In this game, you'll be writing Python code for one or two players. Whenever it's your player's turn, your code will be executed from the beginning.</p>
    <p>The game board consists of cells named a, b, c, d, e, f, g, h, and i. You have two ways to access each cell: using a variable with its name or using the cells dictionary with the key of that cell's name. For example, for a cell named a, you can use either <code>a</code> or <code>cells["a"]</code>.</p>
    <p>To check whether a cell contains X, O, or is empty, you need to write a condition. Please ensure to use capital letters for X and O. Here are some examples:</p>
    <pre><code>if a == "X":  # or if cells["a"] == "X"
    # Do something if cell a contains X

if a == "O":  # or if cells["a"] == "O"
    # Do something if cell a contains O

if a != "X" and a != "O":  # or if cells["a"] != "X" and cells["a"] != "O"
    # Do something if cell a is empty
</code></pre>
    <p>To choose the cell you want to fill on each turn, assign the name of that cell to a variable named <code>result</code>. For example, to fill cell a, use <code>result = "a"</code>.</p>
    <p>If your code doesn't set the <code>result</code> variable on your turn, the game will randomly select one of the empty cells for you.</p>
    <p>For instance, if you want to fill cell a only if it is empty, you can write the following code:</p>
    <pre><code>if a != "X" and a != "O":  # or if cells["a"] != "X" and cells["a"] != "O"
    result = "a"
</code></pre>
    <p>This code checks if cell a is not occupied by either X or O. If it's empty, it assigns "a" to the <code>result</code> variable, indicating your choice to fill that cell.</p>
    <p>Feel free to customize and enhance the code to implement your desired strategies and game logic.</p>
    <p>Enjoy playing the game!</p>
